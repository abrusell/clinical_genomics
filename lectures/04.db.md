# Variant annotation

-	Once called, variants (SNPs and InDels) need to be annotated
-	We want to know for example if a variant is located in a gene, if itâ€™s in the coding portion of that gene, if it causes an aminoacid substitution, if that substitution is deleterious for the encoded protein function.
-	**Variant annotation** is the process of attaching biological information from multiple available source (**public databases**) to variants

### Gene model

-	The choice of gene model is essential for variant downstream variant annotation:
- RefSeq [RefSeq]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/)
- Ensembl [Ensembl] (https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Info/Index)
- Gencode [Gencode] (https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/)
