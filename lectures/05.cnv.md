# Copy Number Variants

---

- *Copy Number Variants* (CNVs) are imbalances in the genomic material of an individual that result in either DNA **deletions** (copy loss) or **duplications**
- *CNVs* can cause/predispose to human diseases by altering gene structure/dosage or by **position effect**
- *CNV* size ranges from 50 bp to megabases
- Classical methods to identify *CNVs* use array-based technologies (SNP/CGH)
- Computational approaches have been developed to identify *CNVs* from targeted sequencing data

# Identification of CNVs from targeted sequencing data

---

### Computational approaches

- There are four main methods for *CNV* identification from NGS data (see figure below):
  - **Read Count** (RC)
  - **Read Pair** (RP)
  - **Split Read** (SR)
  - **De Novo Assembly** (AS)
RP and SR require continuous coverage of the *CNV* region or reads encompassing *CNV* breakpoints, as in whole genome sequencing. The sparse nature and small size of exonic targets hamper the application of these methods to targeted sequencing.
