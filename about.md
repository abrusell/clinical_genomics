Background In years 2018-2019, we organized on behalf of the Italian Society of Human Genetics (SIGU) an itinerant Galaxy-based “hands-on-computer” training activity entitled “Data analysis and interpretation for clinical genomics”, exploiting computational resources available at CINECA (https://www.cineca.it/). This one-day course was held three times on invitation from different Italian institutions (Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Rome, University of Genova, SIGU 2018 annual scientific meeting in Catania, University of Bari) and was offered to about 30 participants each time among clinical doctors, biologists, laboratory technicians and bioinformaticians. Topics covered by the course were NGS data quality check, detection of variants, copy number alterations and runs of homozygosity, annotation and filtering and clinical interpretation of sequencing results.

Aim To meet the constant need for training on basic NGS analysis and interpretation of sequencing data in the clinical setting. 

Methods We designed an on-line Galaxy-based training resource dedicated to this topic, articulated in presentations and practical assignments by which students will learn how to approach NGS data processing at the level of fastq, bam and VCF files and clinically-oriented examination of variants emerging from sequencing experiments such as whole exomes.

Results To this end, on behalf of SIGU we have created a repository (https://github.com/sigu-training)  to collect training materials and we plan to populate the Galaxy training website (https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/) with such contributions under the umbrella of SIGU training.

Conclusions We anticipate accumulating basic and advanced training materials about the topic, constantly expanding, of clinical genome analysis and interpretation within the Galaxy Training Network.

> The *Italian Society of Human Genetics* (**SIGU**) was established on November 14, 1997, when the pre-existing Italian Association of Medical Genetics and the Italian Association of Medical Cytogenetics joined. SIGU is one of the 27 member societies of FEGS (Federation of European Genetic Societies).
Animated by a predominant scientific spirit, SIGU wants to be reference for all health-care issues involving human genetics in all its applications.
Its specific missions are to develop quality criteria for medical genetic laboratories, to promote writing of guidelines in the field of human genetics and public awareness of the role and limitations of genetic diagnostic techniques. 
SIGU coordinates activities of several working groups: Clinical Genetics, Cytogenetics, Prenatal Diagnosis, Neurogenetics, Fingerprinting, Oncological Genetics, Immunogenetics, Genetic Counseling, Quality Control, Medical Genetics Services, Bioethics. More than 1000 medical geneticists and biologists are active members of the society.
