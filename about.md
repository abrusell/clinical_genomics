> The *Italian Society of Human Genetics* (**SIGU**) was established on November 14, 1997, when the pre-existing Italian Association of Medical Genetics and the Italian Association of Medical Cytogenetics joined. SIGU is one of the 27 member societies of FEGS (Federation of European Genetic Societies).
Animated by a predominant scientific spirit, SIGU wants to be reference for all health-care issues involving human genetics in all its applications.
Its specific missions are to develop quality criteria for medical genetic laboratories, to promote writing of guidelines in the field of human genetics and public awareness of the role and limitations of genetic diagnostic techniques. 
SIGU coordinates activities of several working groups: Clinical Genetics, Cytogenetics, Prenatal Diagnosis, Neurogenetics, Fingerprinting, Oncological Genetics, Immunogenetics, Genetic Counseling, Quality Control, Medical Genetics Services, Bioethics. More than 1000 medical geneticists and biologists are active members of the society.
